Title: Fast Nearest Neighbour Search (Wraps ANN Library) Using
    L2 Metric
Version: 2.6.1
Author: Sunil Arya and David Mount (for ANN), Samuel E. Kemp,
    Gregory Jefferis
Maintainer: Gregory Jefferis <jefferis@gmail.com>
Description: Finds the k nearest neighbours for every point in a
    given dataset in O(N log N) time using Arya and Mount's ANN library
    (v1.1.3). There is support for approximate as well as exact searches,
    fixed radius searches and 'bd' as well as 'kd' trees. The distance is
    computed using the L2 (Euclidean) metric. Please see package 'RANN.L1'
    for the same functionality using the L1 (Manhattan, taxicab) metric.
